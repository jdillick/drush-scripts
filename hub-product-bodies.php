There\'s the giant whale shark—longer than two school buses but gentle enough to swim with humans; and the swell shark, which can wedge itself into a hideout and then swell so that it cannot be pulled out. There are sharks that lay eggs and sharks that have live babies. Some are small enough to fit into the palm of your hand, and some have teeth bigger than your fist.

Old Armadillo can hear the distant sound of laugher and voices as children scamper from house to house calling “Happy Halloween.” Shuffling down his walkway, Old Armadillo sets jack-o’-lanterns on the edges of the flagstones. He is ready for Halloween. Inside his casita, he settles down before the fire with a mug of hot cocoa and his favorite book of ghost stories, waiting for goblins, pirates, and princesses to come knocking. Old Armadillo waits and waits and wonders if he ever will be visited by trick-or-treaters. Meanwhile, outside, Roadrunner, Bear, Peccary, and other friends are planning a Halloween surprise for Old Armadillo. But when friends knock on his door, they find another surprise in store.
